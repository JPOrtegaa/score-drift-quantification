    Methods like CC, e PWK s√≥ precisam de:
        - y_pred
    
    GAC and GPAC methods must have:
        - y_pred_train
        - y_pred
        
        
    You don't have to put all the arguments, just the ones that are necessary for the method you are going to use.
    The arguments that are not necessary for the method will be ignored.
    
    If you pass any arguments, you must put learner on the quantification methods to None, for example:
    
    DyS = mq.DyS(learner=None) or DyS = mq.DyS()
    
    and call fit and predict the normal way.
    
    dys.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predict = dys.predict(X_test)
